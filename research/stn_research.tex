            {Studied papers on the proposed and already existing algorithms for finding minimal weights in simple temporal networks.}

            {Developed a benchmarking setup to compare the proposed algorithm with an existing solution on randomly generated graphs.}
            \subItemOfItem
            {Identified weaknesses in the algorithm using a \textbf{profiler}, running it on graphs of sizes from 100 to 3000 vertices.}
            \subItemOfItem
            {Improved the graph library used for the project by increasing test coverage and reducing the cyclomatic complexity of vertex removal methods.}
            \subItemOfItem
            {Improved the proposed algorithm by reducing the complexity of some functions from $O(n^3)$ to $O(mn)$ and from $O(n\cdot log(n) + m)$ to $O(m\cdot log(n) + m)$, resulting in \textbf{better performance than the existing solution}.}

            {Currently conducting experiments with different graph and update generators and writing a paper on found results.}
